# Internal memory scanning

This is just for learning purposes.

The goal is to have a value scan similar to cheat engine

then maybe use it to create patterns ?

that would be pog

## Current state :
the scan works if you know the average memory region of the value,

The problem being that idk where a program values are, they are not close to the program's module base

they seem to be randomized each time i run the dummy program, unlike the program's module addr which seems to be static
